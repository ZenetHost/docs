# PSA: Inactive Accounts
## This blog is about a recent update to the management of inactive accounts


To free up server space, we have resorted to suspending and deleting accounts that are inactive and clogging up nodes.
To make sure this does not affect you, take the following measures:

Log on every 14 days, if you don't, your server will get suspended.
If you get suspended, you have 2 days to contact us and reactivate your account, if you don't contact us, it will be automatically deleted in 2 days.

Make sure you follow these measures to keep your server online. Reactivation of your suspended account can be done in a Discord server ticket (only valid for 2 days after suspension)

If you have any questions, feel free to hit us up in a ticket on our Discord server.

I think that's all for today,
Cactus signing off.
