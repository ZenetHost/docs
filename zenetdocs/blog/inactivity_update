# PSA: Inactive Accounts
## This blog is about a recent update to the management of inactive accounts

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902903389610983465/999369225888088164/Zenet.png)

To free up server space, we have resorted to suspending and deleting accounts that are inactive and clogging up nodes.
To make sure this does not affect you, take the following measures:

Log on every 60 days, if you don't you get suspended.
If you get suspended once but your account is reactivated and are inactive for another 14 days, your account and all data is deleted.
Make sure you follow these measures to keep your data and account. Reactivation of your suspended account can be done in a Discord server ticket (only valid for 2 days after suspension)

If you have any questions, feel free to hit us up in a ticket on our Discord server.

I think that's all for today,
Cactus signing off.
