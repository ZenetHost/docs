# API - Getting Started

In this docs we are gonna use JavaScript only. So make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js") installed

Let's make a folder and name it whatever you want.
In that folder, open CMD and type
```jsx
npm init -y
```
Remove the `-y` if you want to enter custom parameters, but that's not necessary.
It should make a `package.json` file. You don't need to touch that file for now.

Now let's install the module that can control our API and make it easy for us. 
```jsx
npm i nodeactyl
```
Now let's make a main file. Doesn't matter how you call it, I will call it `main.js`. Just remember that it need to have the `.js` at the end
