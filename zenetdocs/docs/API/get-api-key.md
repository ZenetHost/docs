# Getting an API key
:::caution

Regular users don't need this, if you have no idea what you're doing and someone told you to give them your API key for example, don't do it, it could be used against you!

:::

In order for you to be able to work with the API, you need to have an API key. Either an "Admin" one, that affects all users and servers **or** a "Client" one, which only affects the servers of one user. 
As you will most likely will not be able to obtain an "Admin" key, we will be working with a "Client" one in this tutorial.

## Locating the "API Credentials" submenu
It's really easy to get your own API key, so let's get started.

Firstly, navigate yourself to the `Account` section from the main dashboard.
If you don't know how [look at "How to change password"](https://wiki.zenet.host/docs/Getting%20started/changepassword "How to change password")

Now, switch to the `API Credentials` submenu by pressing the corresponding button on the left under the title "Account".
After that, you should see something like this:

Now, add a description to your API key and if you want to limit the IP's that can be used, you can! That means, that even if your API key is compromised, they won't be able to use it. After you fill out everything you need, click on the `CREATE` button.

You should now see this, but there will be your key instead of the blurred rectangle. Make a screenshot or note of the key, because it won't be shown again, which means if you lose it, you'll need to create a new one.
