# API - Getting API key

It's really easy to get your own API key, so let's get started

Firstly go to **user settings** > **API Credentials**
if you don't know how [look at "How to change password"](https://wiki.zenet.host/docs/Getting%20started/backup "look at "How to change password"")

You should see this:

Now, add description to your API key and if you want limit the ip's that can be used so even if your API key is found somewhere by someone that should not have have access to it can't use it. After you add everything you need click on `Create` button.

You should see this, but there will be your key. Make a screenshot or something because the key wont be shown again, so if you lose it you'll need to create a new one
