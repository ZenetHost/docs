# ðŸ”— How to contribute
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/ZenetHost/docs/tree/main/zenetdocs/docs

2. Look for a folder that has the topic as its name

3. Look inside the folder and check if your topic isn't already there

4. Create a [filename].md file and type the tutorial there

5. After you're done, click on *Propose new file*. That will create a fork of our docs

6. Create a pull request with your change and wait

We are very happy for every contribution ðŸ’–
