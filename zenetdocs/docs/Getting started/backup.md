# ðŸ“¼ Backups
Backups are very important parts of every project running on cloud. Because of that, every free user has 1 free backup space for every server.

So, to create a backup, log into the panel and click on your server.
Next, switch from the console to the "Backups" tab and click on "Create Backup".
