# ðŸ“¼ Backups
Backups are a very important part of every project running on cloud. Because of that, every free user has 1 free backup space for their server. On this page, you will learn how to create a backup.

## 1. Locating the "Backup" tab
So, to start, we first need to locate the backup tab under your server's dashboard. To do that, simply click your server on the main page and click `Backups` on the left, just as you see it in the image

## 2. Creating a backup
Once you get to the backup tab, click `CREATE BACKUP`.

Once you've done that, a box like this should appear:

In there, enter the name of your backup and if you want, you can ignore some files like `gitignore` or folders like `node_modules`. You can lock the backup, resulting in more prevention againist overwriting or deleting it, as you have to manually unlock it first.

After you click `START BACKUP`, it will take a bit and voilÃ , you've got yourself a backup.

If you want to download, restore, lock/unlock or delete the backup, you can click on the 3 dots next to your backup to display the available options.
