# ðŸ˜® What to do after registering

Today we are gonna cover what to do after you register via register form [register.zenet.host]

after you register you should see this:

Nice! you created an account. The username is your email adress without the characters after @. So if my email is docs@zenet.host my username is docs.
You should get an email from us with a link to set your password. 
If you want to request a server or request username change(for some weird reason) you need to join our discord and create a **ticket**
