# üîê Registering with Zenet
You can register either through an online form or through a Discord ticket. After you register, you will still need to join our Discord to request a server. Please keep in mind, that you can only register **one** account per household.
Your username will be automatically set to the name you have infront of the **@** sign in your email you will give us during registration. If you wish, you can request a change of your username later in a Discord ticket (You will see how to create one later on this page). 

## 1. Account creation
### Through an online form
Firstly, head to [register.zenet.host](https://register.zenet.host "Register") and fill out your email.

After you register, you are done! Well, almost. You should see this screen:

As said in the image, you should receive an email with a link to set your password. If you don't receive an email after 10 minutes have passed from the time of your registration, make a support ticket by following the instructions below. Be sure to check all your email folders (including spam) first. The email you receive should look something like this:

### Through a support ticket
Firstly, you need to join our Discord server

[Join our Discord server](https://zenet.host/discord "Discord")

After you join, locate a channel named ``üé´‚îÇcreate-ticket``

Click on the ``Create ticket`` button, explain what you need (registration in this case) and follow the instructions given to you by staff. If you don't get a response in your ticket after 12 hours, you can ping a staff member (preferably an online one), but follow the rank hierarchy (start by pinging Support Staff, if they don't respond, ping an Admin, then  a Developer, etc.)

## 2. Server creation

Once you receive your password, you can create a ticket (or use an existing one, based on the method you chose for account creation) to request a server creation. You can see how to create a ticket above. Your server must follow the rules listed in the channel `üìërules` and must not use resources bigger than the ones allocated to you according to the [pricing](https://zenet.host/pricing.html) page (1 GB RAM, 50% CPU, 2 GB Storage and no game server hosting for free users).
