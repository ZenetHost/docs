# 🔐 Registering with Zenet

You can register through an online form or through a Discord ticket. When you register, you will still need to join our Discord to request a server.

# Registration through an online form

Head to [register.zenet.host](https://register.zenet.host "register.zenet.host") and fill out your email.
Your username will be everything before the **@** sign in your email. If you wish, you can request a change of your username later in a Discord ticket. 
After you register, you are done! You should receive an email with a link to set your password shortly. If you don't receive an email to 24 hours from your registration, make a support ticket, following the instructions below.
