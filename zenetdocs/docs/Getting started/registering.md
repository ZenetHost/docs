# 🔐 Registering with Zenet
You can register either through an online form or through a Discord ticket. After you register, you will still need to join our Discord to request a server.

## Registration through an online form
Firstly, head to [register.zenet.host](https://register.zenet.host "Register") and fill out your email.
Your username will be everything before the **@** sign in your email. If you wish, you can request a change of your username later in a Discord ticket. 

After you register, you are done! You should receive an email with a link to set your password shortly. If you don't receive an email to 24 hours from your registration, make a support ticket by following the instructions below.
## Registration through a Discord ticket

[Join our Discord server](https://zenet.host/discord "Discord")

Click on the ``Create ticket`` button, explain what you need (registration in this case) and follow the instructions given to you by staff. If you don't get a response in your ticket after 12 hours, you can ping a staff member (preferably an online one), but follow the rank hierarchy (start by pinging Support Staff, if they don't respond, ping an Admin, then  a Developer, etc.)
